- Purpose: I want to create a persoanl expense tracking tool where users can log their daily expenses, categorize them (groceries, entertainment, transportation, etc), and then see their spending over time. I want the tool to be able to show the user how much is spent in each category, with the addition of a summary and different statistics lke total spending, average daily spending, and category breakdowns. Considering how I am getting older, I want to be able to manage my own expenses positively. That starts with seeing how much I spend and then changing my spending habits based on those results.
- Functionality/Interface: The user would input an expense, specify the amount, and assign it to a category. The tool I create will store the data and allow the user to see a summary and different statistics of their expenses for that week or month. Like I said, the tool will display statistics like total spent, most expensive category, and average daily spending. The user could visualize the expense breakdown with a chart.
- Libraries/Tools:
  - Google Colab
  - Python for logic
  - Pandas for data
  - Matplotlib for data visualization
- Success: It will be successful if the user can input expenses, view their expense history, and get a summary and statistics. The tool will only output meaningful summaries, as I've outlined above. And the tool will provde a simple visualization such as a chart showing the proporton of spending in each category.
